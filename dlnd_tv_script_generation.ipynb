    "In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,\"fake\" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.\n",
